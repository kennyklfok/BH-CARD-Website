            For all stress tests, 10 stickers (electrodes) will be placed on
            your chest.

              <li>
                Clothing from the waist up will need to be removed to allow for electrode placement.

            The persantine medication simulates exercise in patients who are

              <li>
                If you have asthma or other respiratory conditions, please

              Possible side effects include:

            The Dobutamine stress test is performed when an exercise or

          <div>
            Dobutamine works by stimulating the heart to beat faster and more
            strongly, similar to the effects of exercise.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Please inform the technologist if you have a history of heart

              The Dobutamine medication is administered gradually through an IV
              line.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your heart rate, blood pressure, and ECG will be continuously

            </li>
            <li>
              If the target heart rate is not achieved, then the clinic doctor may choose to administer atropine to help increase your heart rate.

            <li>
              After a brief recovery period to ensure any side effects have
