## Folder Structure
- `public/` – Static assets such as images and downloadable documents  
- `src/` – JavaScript and CSS source files  
- `dist/` – Build output generated by Vite  
- HTML files for each service at the project root (`index.html`, `ecg.html`, `holter.html`, etc.)  

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 – semantic page structure  
- CSS3 – layout, responsive design, and styling  
- JavaScript – client-side interactions and navigation  
- Vite – development server, bundling, and build tool  
- Firebase – hosting and deployment  

## Deployment
The website is hosted on Firebase Hosting. The deployment process includes:
1. Adding or updating files in `public/` and HTML pages.  
2. Running the Vite build:  
   ```bash
   npm run build
3. Deploying only hosting to Firebase:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy
4. Hard-refresh the browser (Ctrl+F5) to avoid caching issues after deployment.
